# ATM-Simulation

This is a Java project that uses Swing to implement the GUI. 
Essentially, this is a program that acts as an ATM simulation, one a customer would see and interact with if they were using a real ATM. 
The project includes fully functional buttons, with a number pad and confirmation buttons. 
It also has a complete login feature, with other ATM interactions such as accessing accounts and completing transactions.
